This visualzing can help the engineers to do a fast identifaction of problams in the IC engine and in the Elctrical system.

The application was built using two main python modules:
* StreamLit - Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc.
* PANDAS - Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks
